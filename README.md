# mustachebash.com Public Site Source

Standalone development environment for the static site files for https://mustachebash.com

## Getting Started
### Dev Environment setup:
In order to do any meaningful development, you'll need to get the API up and running as well. Refer to https://github.com/mustachebash/dev for directions. Do not clone this repo directly. You'll need Node 12+ and npm 6.5+ for this repo specifically.

### React DevTools
DevTools is included with this repo as a standalone Electron app. For React performance profiling and standard component debugging, use the command `npm run start:debug` instead, and the DevTools window will open automatically. This can cause a minor performance hit and tax your computer when developing, so only run it when needed.
